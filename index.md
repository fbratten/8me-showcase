# Learn AI Agent Orchestration

From simple loops to sophisticated multi-agent systems.

## What is 8me?

8me teaches the **fundamentals of AI agent orchestration** - how to make AI systems that reliably complete tasks through persistent, verified loops.

## The Core Idea

```
Success = Imperfect AI × Persistent Loop × External Verification
```

AI models aren't perfect. But when you combine them with:
- **Loops** that keep trying
- **Verification** that confirms success
- **Safety limits** that prevent runaway

You get **reliable automation**.

## Start Learning

| | |
|---|---|
| **🚀 Quick Start** | New to loops? [Your First Loop Tutorial](./labs/01-first-loop.md) |
| **📚 Concepts** | Understand the theory: [Orchestration Concepts](./docs/concepts/) |
| **🧪 Labs** | Hands-on practice: [Lab Curriculum](./labs/index.md) (15 progressive labs) |
| **💻 Code** | Working implementations: [8me Repository](https://github.com/fbratten/8me) |

## Tier Overview

| Tier | What You'll Learn |
|------|-------------------|
| 0-1 | Basic loops, verification, state management |
| 2 | Claude Code skill integration |
| 3 | MCP server development |
| 3.5 | Orchestration patterns and providers |
| 4-5 | Production systems and best practices |

## Why "Ralph Wiggum"?

The name comes from a methodology popularized by Geoffrey Huntley: **loop persistently until the job is done**. Like the Simpsons character who doesn't give up, this approach succeeds through determination rather than perfection.

*For the AI nerds:* This was the common approach before sophisticated orchestration frameworks. Sometimes the old ways persist because they work.
